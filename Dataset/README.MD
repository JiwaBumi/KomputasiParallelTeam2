- The way our code works, dataset and patterns must be included as .txt for our algorithm to read from.  
- It exactly has to be .txt, which is why for dataset, FASTA file that we got had to be converted first. We used clean_dataset.py 
- Just make sure to change the input name on the code, whether its the actual algorithm or clean_dataset.py. Any code, watch for the input    
- As for patterns, just write down what to look for.  
- Our algorithm is meant to read 10 letters for each pattern, and new line for each pattern.
