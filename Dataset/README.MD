- The way our code works, dataset and patterns must be included as .txt for our algorithm to read from.  
- It exactly has to be .txt, which is why for dataset, FASTA file that we got had to be converted first using prepare_dna_dataset.py clean_dataset.py, and clean_uncut.py  
- Just make sure to change the input name on the code.  
- As for patterns, just write down what to look for.  
- Our algorithm is meant to read 10 letters for each pattern, and new line for each pattern.
