The way our code works, dataset and patterns must be included as .txt for our algorithm to read from.  
It exactly has to be .txt, which is why for dataset, FASTA file that we got had to be converted first using prepare_dna_dataset.py clean_dataset.py, and clean_uncut.py  
Just make sure to change the input name on the code.

As for pattern, just mention what to look for.  
Our algorithm is meant to length 10 and new line for each pattern.
