#  Parallel String Matching with CUDA

Link Google Docs : https://docs.google.com/document/d/1UJy5XhpXYB6y1YbmfB4oBHEgdm9OmMm5oTTPSiQlqOU/edit?usp=sharing

This project implements and compares two string matching algorithms, **Rabin-Karp** and **Aho-Corasick**, in both serial (CPU) and parallel (GPU) versions using **CUDA**. The goal is to evaluate their performance when applied to large-scale genomic data, specifically DNA sequences of *Mus musculus* (house mouse).

---

##  Project Objectives
- To implement the **Rabin-Karp** and **Aho-Corasick** algorithms in both serial and parallel versions.
- To optimize and run the parallel versions using **CUDA** for GPU acceleration.
- To measure and compare the **execution time** and **memory usage** of both algorithms.
- To analyze which algorithm performs better under parallel processing on large DNA datasets.

---

##  Dataset
We use genomic sequence data (nucleotide) as the input text and pattern:
- Source: [NCBI Genome - Mus musculus](https://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/datasets/genome/GCF_000001635.27/)
- You can modify or generate custom pattern sequences to test scalability.

---

##  Technologies Used
- **CUDA Toolkit** (GPU parallel programming)
- **C/C++** for algorithm implementation
- **NVIDIA Nsight Systems** for profiling
- **Makefile** or shell commands for execution
- **Git** and **GitHub** for version control and documentation

##  How to Run (WIP, below are placeholders)

### Compile
```bash
# For Rabin-Karp
cd rabin_karp_cuda
make

# For Aho-Corasick
cd aho_corasick_cuda
make
```

### Execute
```bash
./rabin_karp input.txt pattern.txt
./aho_corasick input.txt pattern.txt
```

### Profiling
Run this command in the same directory as the compiled file:
```bash
nsys profile -o rk_profile ./rabin_karp input.txt pattern.txt
```

---

##  Output & Analysis (WIP, below are placeholders)
After execution, profiling data such as:
- Total execution time
- Kernel performance
- Memory usage

...are collected using Nsight Systems and converted into tables and graphs. All results are analyzed in the final report.
